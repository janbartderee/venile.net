            The Nile River is recognized as one of the world&apos;s longest
            rivers and has served as Egypt&apos;s lifeline for thousands of
            years. North of Cairo the Nile enters the delta region, a level
            triangular and fertile lowland. The delta was created by sediment
            deposits, it is a crucial centre for agricultural and sustains a
            large portion of Egypt&apos;s population (Hurst et al., 2024; Scown
            et al., 2023; Zeydan, 2006).
          </h5>
          <p>
            The existence and growth of the city of Cairo are deeply rooted in
            the river&apos;s history and cultural significance (AlSayyad &
            Abu-Lughod, 2024). Alexandria, another major city in Egypt, is known
            for its historical grandeur and strategic location on the
            Mediterranean coast. Founded by Alexander the Great in 332 BCE,
            Alexandria was once a centre of Hellenic scholarship and science,
            and served as the capital of Egypt until 642 CE (Reimer et al.,
            2024).
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite the water that has made the region so vital for sustaining
            life and agriculture, the Nile Delta is now facing a multitude of
            challenges that threaten its future (Haars et al., 2016; IPCC, 2022;
            D. J. Stanley & Warne, 1998).

          <h4>Water Scarcity in the Nile Delta</h4>
          <p>
            Among the challenges threatening the Nile Delta, water scarcity
            stands out as a particularly complex issue. Factors such as rapid
            population growth and urbanization have escalated the demand for
            (unpolluted) water (Abdelhafez et al., 2020; Omran, 2017; Wahba et
            al., 2005). This is particularly evident in densely populated cities
            like Cairo and Alexandria. Concurrently, inefficient irrigation
            practices and outdated infrastructure contribute to substantial
            water loss (Abd-Elmabod et al., 2019). Climate change further
            compounds the problem, with increased temperatures leading to higher
            evaporation rates (Siam & Eltahir, 2017). Additionally, upstream
            activities such as damming and water diversions have diminished the
            Nile&apos;s flow, impacting the volume of water that reaches the
            delta (Redeker & Kantoush, 2014).

          <h4>Effects and Measures of Water Scarcity</h4>
          <p>
            Water scarcity in the Nile Delta has far-reaching effects, impacting
            sectors like agriculture, public health, and socio-economic
            stability. A decrease in water availability can result in crop
            failure, food insecurity, and heightened competition for resources
            (Radwan et al., 2019). To address this, measures such as enhancing
            irrigation efficiency, advocating for water conservation, and
            investigating alternative water sources like desalination are being
            pursued (Sallam, 2018; Tawfik et al., 2024). Policy modifications
            and international collaboration are also integral to sustainable
            water management in the region.

            Land subsidence is the highest in the Nile Delta&apos;s coastal
            regions (Marriner et al., 2012)
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="twothird">
          <h4>Land Subsidence in the Nile Delta</h4>
          <p>
            Land subsidence, or the sinking of land, is a significant concern in
            the Nile Delta. The primary cause of this phenomenon is the
            extraction of groundwater, which leads to land compaction and
            subsequent sinking (Bucx et al., 2014; J.-D. Stanley & Clemente,
            2017). Land subsidence, coupled with sea-level rise due to climate
            change, heightens the risk of flooding and saltwater intrusion into
            freshwater resources (Omran, 2017; Sefelnasr & Sherif, 2014).
            Saltwater intrusion can degrade soil quality and render agricultural
            land infertile, jeopardizing the livelihoods of farming communities
            (Tully et al., 2019). This is particularly concerning for cities
            like Alexandria, which are located on the coast and heavily reliant
            on the delta&apos;s resources (Edmonds et al., 2020). Mitigation
            efforts include regulating groundwater extraction and implementing
            strategies to adapt to sea-level rise, such as the construction of
            sea walls and the development of salt-tolerant crops (A. El-Masry,
            2022; Abd-Elhamid et al., 2016; Tully et al., 2019).

          <h4>Flooding in the Nile Delta</h4>
          <p>
            Flooding poses a significant threat to the Nile Delta, particularly
            due to the combined effects of land subsidence and sea-level rise
            (Hereher, 2010; Hzami et al., 2021). This is especially problematic
            for coastal cities like Alexandria, which face a heightened risk of
            flooding. Historically, the annual flooding of the Nile River was a
            natural and beneficial event, depositing nutrient-rich silt onto the
            delta&apos;s farmlands (Tawfik et al., 2024; Zeydan, 2006). However,
            the construction of the Aswan High Dam has significantly curtailed
            these floods, altering the delta&apos;s natural dynamics. Presently,
            the delta faces the risk of flooding from rising sea levels and the
            increased intensity and frequency of storm events (Hzami et al.,
            2021). Sea level rise could submerge 19% of the delta area and
            affect 6.1 million people, (Eldeberky, 2011). Effective adaptation
            and mitigation strategies are therefore crucial.<br /><br />
